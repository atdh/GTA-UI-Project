int main()
{
    /*
    First, I load my cpp files. I create a load file function for that
    (I make use of file io, if, else, and while loop, of,stream here)
    
    Second, I make a main menu. I make naother function for that. Here I will welcome user to the main menu. If user chooses to quit
    print goodbye. If user chooses s, start the game. 
    
    Once the game starts, I ask user to input name. If name exists in file, welcome back. If not welcome to the game. I ask user for gender. if male
    I make a male character and user he, him, etc in the game. If femaler, I use she, her, etc in the game.
    
    Third, I make use of car header file. cars will come and go on random.(I make another funciton for random generator). Each time a car comes,
    I bring back an interactive feature. Do you want to rob this car? (y)es or (n)0. if yes, what weapon would you like to use? (f)ist, (k)nife,
    (g)un. after robbing the person, would you also like to rob the car? (y)es or (n)o. Pring successive message. Make another random function where
    if player chooses to rob someone, that person might also have a weapon. Print succesful message after robbing someone. 
    cout<<success<<. then I can go to craiglist and sell the items. I will make eahc weapon worth certain money and each items worh tthe same. This will
    be hardcoded into the game.
    
    Fourth, Once a player acquires 100k, game will end with him going to the bahamas for vacation. If a player gets killed before that I go back to 
    menu option.
    
    Fifth, I will also create a random generator funciton for undercover cops. If player gets caught, I will have a chance to bribethe cop or attack.
    Note the cops will have guns. unlike normal emeies wiht gun, cops will shoot with more accuracy so damage more likely. you will have chance to
    (b)ribe the cop, (r)un, (a)ttack. If caught, game over. If killed gameover. brive rate- i will use random generator funciton.
